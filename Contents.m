%% DEMOs on how to use HyBRrecycle
%
%   DEMO_Deblurring.m     Sets up and runs a 2D image deblurring problem
%                           corresponding to the results in Section 4.1 
%                           of the paper
%
%   DEMO_Tomo.m           Sets up and runs a 2D streaming tomgraphy problem
%                           with two sets of data.  
%                           This example with n = 1024 corresponds to 
%                           Case 1 of Section 4.2.1 in the paper.

%% Supporting MATLAB functions
%
% HyBRrecycle.m           Main code to run HyBR with recycling
%                         Syntax: [x_out, output, trunc_mats] =
%                         HyBRrecycle(A, b, P, options, trunc_options, trunc_mats
% 
% recyclingGKB.m          Code to perform one step of the recycling GKB
%                         process
%
% compression.m           Code to perform basis compression. Here we
%                         provide four compression approaches: 
%                         SVD, solution, sparse and RBD.
